This program is used for text encryption and decryption. The two data structures used are Binary Search Tree and Queue, BST is used to store the mappings
used for encryption and decryption as the time complexity of traversal  in BST is O(log n) which is efficient compared to most other data types.

Queue is used as a transition medium for the message as each encrypted/decrypted word is enqueued till the whole message is stored. The stored message 
is then outputed on the terminal and a file using dequeue function.
